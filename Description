Analyzing Mortality Trends in Neurological and Epileptic Disorders Across U.S. States.....................................................................................................

This project aims to investigate trends in neurological and epileptic mortality across all U.S. states from 1999 to 2020. 
By analyzing mortality counts and population data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
the study examines whether these deaths are rising disproportionately in certain areas or at alarming rates nationwide.

Dataset:

Underlying Cause of Death, 1999-2020.txt: This file contains annual death and population counts related to overall neurological disorders across all U.S. states for the period 1999–2020.
Underlying Cause of Death, 1999-2020 Epilepsy.txt: This file provides annual death and population counts specifically for epilepsy-related disorders 
over the same time frame and for the same states.

Task.......................................................................................................................................................................................
Conducted Comprehensive Mortality Trend Analysis: Analyzed mortality data on neurological and epileptic disorders across all U.S. states from 1999 to 2020, 
identifying regional variations in death rates and counts for both conditions.

Utilized CDC Data for Statistical Evaluation: Processed and compared death and population counts from CDC-provided datasets to calculate mortality rates, 
revealing significant disparities in neurological and epilepsy-related deaths across states, with a focus on states like California, Texas, and Florida. 

Identified Key Regional Patterns and Disparities: Investigated state-specific trends, highlighting areas with disproportionately high neurological death rates, 
such as Alaska and Wyoming, and pinpointed regions where epilepsy deaths were particularly impactful despite smaller populations, suggesting environmental and public health considerations.

Results of Analyzing Mortality Trends in Neurological and Epileptic Disorders Across U.S. States...........................................................................................

The analysis of neurological and epileptic death rates and counts across U.S. states reveals significant variations in both mortality rates and absolute death counts. 

Average Death Rates Sorted by Neurological Death Rate:
The states with the highest neurological death rates include California, Texas, and Florida, with death rates exceeding 16,000 per million people. 
These states also show a noticeable presence of epilepsy-related mortality, though the ratio between neurological deaths and epilepsy deaths varies across regions. 
States such as Alaska, Hawaii, and Wyoming report exceptionally high neurological death rates with no recorded epilepsy-related deaths, 
indicating a potential focus on non-epileptic neurological conditions in these regions. 
The calculated epilepsy-to-neurological death rate ratios suggest that, in many states, the neurological death rate far outweighs that of epilepsy, 
especially in states like South Dakota and Montana, where the epilepsy death rates are considerably higher.

Average Death Counts Sorted by Neurological Death Count:
The total number of neurological deaths shows a distinct trend, with large states such as California, Texas, and Florida leading in terms of overall death counts. 
These states exhibit very high absolute death numbers (up to over 16,000 total neurological deaths), correlating with their larger populations. 
In contrast, smaller states like Alaska, Wyoming, and Vermont report significantly fewer neurological deaths, with Alaska’s rate being particularly low in comparison. 
Interestingly, smaller states such as Maine and New Mexico show relatively high epilepsy death counts despite their smaller populations, suggesting that 
epilepsy may have a larger impact in these areas relative to the overall population.

Overall, the data highlights the complex distribution of neurological and epileptic mortality across the U.S., with both higher rates and death counts concentrated in certain states, 
possibly reflecting population size, regional environmental factors, and public health challenges. 
The findings underscore the need for further investigation into environmental and other local factors contributing to these disparities.
